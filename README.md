A school project on the subject of digital communications

Consist of two parts 

Part 1. The study of a PCM system using Lloyd-Max algorithm as quanitizer 
        
        * inputs a sound or image file (cameraman or speech)
        
        * Q1: For N = 2,4,8 
              
              - Quanitze the speech.wav
              - evaluate the changes on the edited sound file
              - calculate and evaluate SQNR values
              - evaluate the changes on the waveform of the signal
        
        *Q2: 
              For N = 2,4,8 
              
              - Quanitze the cameraman
              - evaluate the changes on the edited image file
              - calculate and evaluate SQNR values
              - evaluate the changes on the actual image.
        
        *Q3: simple probability calculations using the expirimental data

Part 2. The study of a M-PAM baseband system

        *q1: creates a standard M-PAM system
                
                -Generates a pulse which as the base of testing (with symbols mapped as Gray encode)
                -Visualizes BER curves for M=4,8 with simple encoding having snr values of [0:20:2]
                -Visualizes SER curves for M=4,8 with simple encoding having snr values of [0:20:2]
